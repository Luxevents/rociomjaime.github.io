		Welcome to my site! I am an undergraduate student at Smith College pursuing a degree in computer science. While I work to obtain a strong understanding of the fundamental material within my field of study, my goal is also to apply the knowledge and skills I learn in real world settings. When I'm not in class, you can most likely find me tutoring statistics/data science at the Smith College quantitative science learning center, or drinking coffee at the school cafe.
